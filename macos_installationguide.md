## Initial Installation Script Creation

1. **Shell script creation**  
   - A shell script named `install_edatools.sh ` was created to automate the installation of dependencies.  
   - The script was created using either `nano` or Visual Studio Code.

2. **Making the script executable**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_edatools.sh
   
3. ** Running the script**
```bash
./install_edatools.sh 
```
**Homebrew Dependency Installation**

In the script, the following packages are installed via Homebrew:

Core build tools: bison, flex, readline, gawk, libffi, graphviz, pkg-config, boost, zlib, tcl-tk, llvm, git, and python@3.13

Note: You may encounter warnings showing some packages are already installed or up to date, which is normal if you already had them.

**Handling Python (PEP 668 Restriction)**
Problem:
When installing Python packages globally with Homebrew‚Äôs Python, an error appears:

error: externally-managed-environment

**This is due to Python‚Äôs PEP 668 compliance, which restricts global pip installs in an externally managed environment.**

Solution:

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venv_edatools
```
Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source ~/.venv_edatools/bin/activate
``
Upgrade pip and install your required packages inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pynput openai 
```
Updated Python Dependency Script
Below is an example of how the Python dependency check might be included in your install_edatools.sh script (or in a separate shell script):


## Function to install Python dependencies
install_python_deps() {
    echo "üêç Checking if inside virtual environment..."

    # $VIRTUAL_ENV is a special environment variable that only exists when inside a venv
    if [ -z "$VIRTUAL_ENV" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå Not in a Python virtual environment. Please run:"
        echo "   source ~/.venv_edatools/bin/activate"
        echo "   pip install pynput openai"
        exit 1
    else
        echo "‚úÖ Python virtual environment detected: $VIRTUAL_ENV"
        echo "‚úÖ Dependencies already installed"
    fi
}
Use this function within your main script if you want to ensure you‚Äôre inside the Python virtual environment before installing dependencies.

## Yosys Build Process
Initial Error
When attempting to build Yosys on macOS (Apple Silicon), the following error was encountered:

nginx

fatal error: 'map' file not found
This typically indicates missing C++ standard headers or compiler configuration issues.

1. Initial Setup & Prerequisites
Attempted using Homebrew commands:
```bash
brew tap Homebrew/bundle && brew bundle
```
This was found to be deprecated, leading to manual installation of each required tool.

Manually installed via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install bison flex readline gawk libffi graphviz pkg-config python@3.11 boost zlib tcl-tk llvm
```
Required tools:

GNU Flex and Bison (for parsing)

Make (or gmake), Python, Clang/GCC

Optional (but often needed): readline, libffi, Tcl, zlib, Graphviz, Xdot

**2. MacPorts & Compiler Configuration**
When Homebrew-based builds still failed, MacPorts was tried as an alternative.

Check MacPorts installation

```bash
port version
```
Should output a version (e.g., Version: 2.8.1).
If missing, install MacPorts from MacPorts.org.

**Install dependencies via MacPorts**

```bash

sudo port install bison flex readline gawk libffi graphviz \pkgconfig python311 boost zlib tcl
```
Update environment

```bash
export PATH="/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Users/yeshwanthreddykatta/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
```
Add the above line to your ~/.zshrc (or appropriate shell configuration file), then:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
Verify Clang version

```bash
which clang-16
```
clang-16 --version
Ensure you have Clang 16 (or a compatible version) installed via MacPorts or otherwise.

3. Yosys Build Configuration
Clone Yosys repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
cd yosys
```
Initialize submodules

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Clean old builds

```bash
gmake clean
```
Edit Makefile.conf
```bash

CONFIG := clang
CXX := /opt/local/bin/clang++-mp-16
CC := /opt/local/bin/clang-mp-16
LDLIBS += -ltcl
ENABLE_ZLIB := 0
ENABLE_TCL := 1
```
Adjust paths and flags as needed if your setup differs.

Build Yosys

```bash
gmake config-clang
gmake -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
```
or 
```bash
gmake
```
After the build completes successfully, you should have a working yosys binary.

Final Notes
Using MacPorts for dependencies and clang-16 proved more reliable on Apple Silicon.
